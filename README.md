## Questions
### What was your motivation?
I wanted to learn as much as possible about multi-page applications and I wanted to design and build a website from scratch. 

### Why did you build this project?
I wanted to build a multi-page application using all of tools that I have learned. I built this as an assignment from the Odin Project curriculum. 

### What did you learn?
* Asynchronous Programming
* Calling APIs
* Reading Documentation
* Bundling with Webpack
* Design best practices
* DOM manipulation

## Challenges
* Design 
* Navigation
* Asynchronous Programming

### Design
I built the sites design from scratch, so a lot of time was spent experimenting with different colors / images to give the site some appeal. If I were to do it again, I would have just used a template. 

### Navigation
For this project, I had to make a multi-page app, as part of the project details from The Odin Project. I struggled to implement navigation into my project using import / export in my directory. 

### Asynchronous Programming
I wanted to call the Google Maps API and display the map on my website. I struggled with how asynchronous programming worked. For this project I barely knew enough to get the result that I wanted. In the end, I still have a bug / error that is left uncaught. 

## Reflection
I would have designed each page individually by laying out some wire frames, and perhaps using Adobe XD for design work. I should have made the site responsive and designed for mobile-first.
